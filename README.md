# QuantEcon

This repository is based on the lectures published by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski. The initial lectures are available at https://lectures.quantecon.org.

In addition to the materials presented by Sargent and Stachurski I include additional material where appropriate. These sections are noted within each Jupyter Notebook.
